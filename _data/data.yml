    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am currently seeking opportunities for a full-time career as an emerging Computer Engineering professional. I have proven leadership skills and 
      will work efficiently to deliver project objectives based on set timing. I am detail oriented, with a strong ability to communicate effectively 
      with team members and superiors. I am also able to confidently convey engineering topics between peers in different fields to ensure company-wide success.
education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: Bachelor's in Computer Engineering
        university: University of Cincinnati
        time:  08/2019 - 05/2024
        details: |
          Completion of a bachelor's degree is based on 5 years of study. This is because the University of Cincinnati College of Engineering and Applied
          Science integrates cooperative education, requiring students to complete a total of 4 co-op (or experiential exploration program) 
          experiences. Similar to an internship, these allow me to have experience in a company environment to prepare for a career after college.
